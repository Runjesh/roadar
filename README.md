An experiment to see if Bluetooth iBeacons could revolutionize safety for cyclists. 

The idea behind this was to see if an app on smart phones using low energy bluetooth could be used to alert/remind motorists that cyclists are in the vicinity and in which direction.

I got this pretty close to working  after hacking around some but currently the beacon tech does not seem to be up to it.

Imagine if it worked? Imagine if all a cyclist needed was a cheap little bluetooth transmitter (low energy, upto 150 meter range) and motorists had an app then showed all the cyclist near by in real time. If the tech worked, it would be cheap enough with enough marketing to maybe reach a tipping point and get everyone using it or the bluetooth receivers in car dashboards them selves. If it worked one day it could maybe, just maybe, account for saving some lives and be cheap enough and easy enough for everyone to use.

It was worth a shot anyway.


## Code

The code is from a year ago now, iOS 8, Objective-C stuff and for a pretty hacky prototype but hey.
