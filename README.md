An experiment to see if Bluetooth iBeacons could revolutionize safety for cyclists. 

The idea behind this was to see if an app on smart phones using low energy bluetooth could be used to alert/remind motorists that cyclists are in the vicinity and in which direction.

I got this pretty close to working after hacking around some but currently the beacon tech does not seem to be up to it.

Imagine if it worked? Imagine if all a cyclist needed was a cheap little bluetooth transmitter (low energy, upto 150 meter range, maybe need charging now and then) and motorists had an app then showed all the cyclists near by in real time. If the tech worked, it would be cheap and affordable for everyone, apps could later be built into cars. With enough marketing to maybe reach a tipping point and get everyone using it. If it worked, if enough people get on board with it. One day it could maybe, just maybe, account for saving some lives and be cheap enough and easy enough for everyone.

It was worth a shot anyway.

## Using it

Install the app on some phones, on one app select yourself as a `Cyclist` on the other as a `Driver`. Make sure Bluetooth is turned on, move around, you should get alerts and see the UI light up with X number of cyclists around and how close they are.

## What is the problem this is tring to solve?

Making the roads safer for cycling. Finding a way to alert/remind drivers "Hey, there is a bike pulling up behind you, just be aware. Oh hey, the bike is moving up on your left."

That would be cool right? But not everyone has a smartphone and an internet connection and endless battery to name just a few hurdles. Enter Bluetooth, low energy, small data being shared over distances of around ~150 meters or more is possible. Inexpensive enough for everyone to buy a little bit of kit that clips on their bike or fits in the pocket (as well as an app on a phone), inexpensive enough to, break and lose and just go buy a new one. Maybe they get build with unique codes so it's not even worth stealing but that's another conversation.

So then you have all these cyclists transmitting there movements around on Bluetooth, enter smartphones, an app like this one can be used to both transmit and receive, in the role of either a cyclist or a driver. Drivers have the app flash up and beep wth alerts an updates of vulnerable road users in their vicnity. Fast foward a decade, it could be built into the dashboard of every new car made, and a transmitter and setup included with every new bike sold.

Cycle safety utopia? It's an idea anyway, feel free to run with it or ask me anything, it would be cool to somehow maybe see it one day in the world, or something completely different and better but it's something to think about :)

## Code

The code is from a year ago now, iOS 8, Objective-C stuff and for a pretty hacky prototype but hey.
